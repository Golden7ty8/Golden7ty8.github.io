        <h1>Alastair </h1>
        <p>WELCOME TO THIS SITE (NOTE (IGNORE THIS FOR NOW UNTIL SKILLS AND PROJECT STUFF IS DONE): we should have buttons at the top for easy category navigation. In order to make this easier we should make said buttons always visible at the top of the page regardless of how far odwn you scroll)
          NOTE: We absolutly need a loading bar for loading the textures, maybe offer oftion to skip???
          NOTE: Plays very strangly with moblie.
          KNOWN BUG: weird effect when scrolling, mainly on phone where you get white border as if we moved off the page a bit.
          KNOWN BUG: Website only re-sizes itself on reload.

          Task List:
          1. Do Research on what should be in a (game programmer) Portfolio. This will impact the design of the site.
          ANSWER: Seems like it's projects and Skills, maybe some extra miscellanious. For now, we will just put everything here as a place to collect all the info.

          2. Learn about buttons, see link in refferences.

        <p>
          - Check Job's Folder for skills to add? Will need to check if that makes sense of a portfolio first. 

          many years in unity, perhaps scrum and agile, maybe little unreal, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, 
          experience with AI and specificly the genetic algorithm (maybe show project on it), ASSEMBLER??? (probably not), and potentially other languages.
